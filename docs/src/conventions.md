We first define the rotor that takes ``(\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z})``
onto ``(\hat{\theta}, \hat{\phi}, \hat{r})``.  Then, we can invert
that, so that given a rotor that specifies such a rotation exactly, we
can get the spherical coordinates ‚Äî or specifically ``\sin\theta``,
``\cos\theta``, and ``\exp(i\phi)``.

Then, with the universally agreed-upon ``Y`` as given in terms of
spherical coordinates, we can rewrite it directly to work with
quaternion components, and then it immediately applies to general
rotations, which allows us to figure out where the ``s`` should go.
That is, we can essentially derive ``{}_sY`` from the universal
formula for ``Y``.

Then, we can simply follow Wigner around Eq. (15.21) to derived a
transformation law in the form
```math
{}_sY_{\ell,m'}(R_{\theta', \phi'}) = \sum_m M_{m',m}(R)
{}_sY_{\ell,m}(R_{\theta, \phi}),
```
for some matrix ``M``.  Note that I have written this as if the
``{}_sY`` functions are column vectors.  The reason this happens is
because I want to write ``R_{\theta', \phi'} = R\, R_{\theta, \phi}``,
rather than swapping the order of the rotations on the right-hand
side.

The big problem here is that Wigner, in his Eq. (15.21) defines the
transformation matrix as if the eigenfunctions formed a row vector
instead of a column vector, which means that his matrix is transposed
compared to what I want to write.  I suppose maybe other authors then
just consider the inverse rotation, so that they can work with the
conjugate transpose, which is why we see the relative conjugate.

* Since ``Y`` is universal, let's start with that as non-negotiable,
  and see if we can derive the relationship to ``\mathfrak{D}``.
* ``R_{\theta, \phi}`` is a unit quaternion that rotates the point
  described by Cartesian coordinates (0,0,1) onto the point described
  by spherical coordinates ``(\theta, \phi)``.
* Just textually, it makes the most sense to write
  ```math
  R_{\theta', \phi'} = R\, R_{\theta, \phi}
  ```
  for some rotation ``R``.  Now, we just need to interpret ``R``.
* Again, just textually, it makes the most sense to write
  ```math
  Y_{\ell,m'}(\theta', \phi') = \sum_m \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(R)
  Y_{\ell,m}(\theta, \phi),
  ```
  or, generalizing to spin-weighted spherical harmonics
  ```math
  {}_{s}Y_{\ell,m'}(R_{\theta', \phi'}) = \sum_m \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(R)
  {}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}(R_{\theta, \phi}).
  ```
* We also have that ``\mathfrak{D}`` obeys the representation
  property, so
  ```math
  \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m''}(R_{\theta', \phi'})
  = \sum_{m} \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(R)
  \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m,m''}(R_{\theta, \phi}).
  ```
  - There is no reason that I can see to introduce a conjugation
  - The fact that ``m''`` appears on both sides of the equation means
    that it must correspond to ``s`` ‚Äî though we have to check the
    behavior under final rotation to determine the sign.

```math
{}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}(R_{\theta, \phi})
\propto
\mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m,\propto s}(R_{\theta, \phi})
```

# Conventions

## Quaternions


## Rotations


## Euler angles and spherical coordinates

We start with a standard Cartesian coordinate system ``(x, y, z)``.
The spherical coordinates ``(r, \theta, \phi)`` are defined by
```math
\begin{aligned}
x &= r \sin\theta \cos\phi, \\
y &= r \sin\theta \sin\phi, \\
z &= r \cos\theta.
\end{aligned}
```
The inverse transformation is given by
```math
\begin{aligned}
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}, \\
\theta &= \arccos\left(\frac{z}{r}\right), \\
\phi &= \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right).
\end{aligned}
```




## Spherical harmonics

Fortunately, there does not seem to be any disagreement in the physics
literature about the definition of the spherical harmonics; everyone
uses the Condon-Shortley convention.  Or at least, they say they do.
The problem arises when people define the spherical harmonics in terms
of the Legendre polynomials, for which there is a sign ambiguity.
Therefore, to ensure that we are using the same conventions, we need
to go back to the original definition of the spherical harmonics by
Condon and Shortley.

### Condon-Shortley phase

The [Condon-Shortley](@cite CondonShortley_1935) phase convention is a
choice of phase factors in the definition of the spherical harmonics
that requires the coefficients in
```math
L_{\pm} |\ell,m\rangle = \alpha^{\pm}_{\ell,m} |\ell, m \pm 1\rangle
```
to be real and positive.  The reasoning behind this choice is
explained more clearly in Section 2 of [Ufford and Shortley
(1932)](@cite UffordShortley_1932).  As a more practical matter, the
Condon-Shortley phase describes signs chosen in the expression for
spherical harmonics.  The key expression is Eq. (15) of section 4¬≥
(page 52) of [Condon-Shortley](@cite CondonShortley_1935):
```math
\Theta(\ell, m) = (-1)^\ell \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{2} \frac{(\ell+m)!}{(\ell-m)!}}
\frac{1}{2^\ell \ell!} \frac{1}{\sin^m\theta}
\frac{d^{\ell-m}}{d(\cos\theta)^{\ell-m}} \sin^{2\ell}\theta.
```
When multiplied by Eq. (5) ``\Phi(m) = e^{im\phi} / \sqrt{2\pi}``,
this gives the spherical harmonic function.  The right-hand side of
the expression above is usually immediately replaced by a simpler
expression using Legendre polynomials, but this just shifts sign
ambiguity into the definition of the Legendre polynomials.  Instead,
we can expand the above expression directly for the first few ``\ell``
values and/or use automatic differentiation to actually test their
original expression as such against the function implemented in this
package.  The first few values are given in a footnote to Condon and
Shortley's Eq. (15) (and have been verified separately by hand and by
computation with SymPy):
```math
\begin{aligned}
\Theta(0,0) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \\
\Theta(1,0) &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \cos\theta &
\Theta(1,\pm1) &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \sin\theta \\
\Theta(2,0) &= \sqrt{\frac{5}{8}} (2\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta) &
\Theta(2,\pm1) &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{15}{4}} \cos\theta \sin\theta &
\Theta(2,\pm2) &= \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} \sin^2\theta \\
\Theta(3,0) &= \sqrt{\frac{7}{8}} (2\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta\sin^2\theta) &
\Theta(3,\pm1) &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{21}{32}} (4\cos^2\theta\sin\theta - \sin^3\theta) &
\Theta(3,\pm2) &= \sqrt{\frac{105}{16}} \cos\theta \sin^2\theta &
\Theta(3,\pm3) &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{35}{32}} \sin^3\theta
\end{aligned}
```
These are tested, along with the results from automatic
differentiation, every time this package is updated.  The result is
perfect agreement, so that we can definitively say that ***the
spherical-harmonic functions provided by this package obey the
Condon-Shortley phase convention.***

## Angular-momentum operators

Wigner's $ùîá$ matrices are defined as matrix elements of a rotation in
the basis of spherical harmonics.  That rotation is defined in terms
of the generators of rotation, which are expressed in terms of the
angular-momentum operators.  Therefore, to really understand
conventions for the $ùîá$ matrices, we need to understand conventions
for the angular-momentum operators.

There is universal agreement that the angular momentum is defined as
``\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{p}``, where ``\mathbf{x}`` is
the position vector and ``\mathbf{p}`` is the momentum vector.  In
quantum mechanics, there is further agreement that the momentum
operator becomes ``-i\hbar\nabla``.  Thus, in operator form, the
angular momentum can be decomposed as
```math
\begin{aligned}
L_x &= -i\hbar \left( y \frac{\partial}{\partial z} - z \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right), \\
L_y &= -i\hbar \left( z \frac{\partial}{\partial x} - x \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right), \\
L_z &= -i\hbar \left( x \frac{\partial}{\partial y} - y \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right).
\end{aligned}
```
We can transform these to use spherical coordinates and obtain
```math
\begin{aligned}
L_x &= -i\hbar \left( \sin\phi \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} + \cot\theta \cos\phi \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi} \right), \\
L_y &= -i\hbar \left( \cos\phi \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} - \cot\theta \sin\phi \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi} \right), \\
L_z &= -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}.
\end{aligned}
```
The conventions we choose *must* be chosen to agree with these ‚Äî
modulo factors of ``\hbar``, which are nonstandard in mathematics.  We
will have to check this, and the Condon-Shortley requirement that when
applied to spherical harmonics they produce real and positive
coefficients.

I defined these in Eqs. (42) and (43) of [Boyle (2016)](@cite Boyle_2016) as
```math
\begin{aligned}
L_{j} f(\mathbf{R}) &\colonequals -z \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
f\left(e^{\theta \mathbf{e}_j / 2} \mathbf{R} \right) \right|_{\theta=0}, \\
K_{j} f(\mathbf{R}) &\colonequals -z \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
f\left(\mathbf{R} e^{\theta \mathbf{e}_j / 2}\right) \right|_{\theta=0},
\end{aligned}
```
where ``\mathbf{e}_j`` is the unit vector in the ``j`` direction.
Surprisingly, I found that [Edmonds](@cite Edmonds_2016) expresses
essentially the same thing in the equations following his Eq. (4.1.5).

Condon and Shortley's Eq. (1) of section 4¬≥ (page 50) defines
```math
L_z = -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi},
```
while Eq. (8) on the following page defines
```math
\begin{aligned}
L_x + i L_y &= \hbar e^{i\phi} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + i \cot\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \right), \\
L_x - i L_y &= \hbar e^{-i\phi} \left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + i \cot\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \right).
\end{aligned}
```
Note that one is not the conjugate of the other!  This is because of
the factors of ``-i`` in the definitions of ``L_x`` and ``L_y``.

[Edmonds](@cite Edmonds_2016) gives the *total* angular-momentum
operator for a rigid body in Eq. (2.2.2) as
```math
\begin{aligned}
L_x &= -i\hbar \left(-\cos \alpha \cot\beta \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} - \sin\alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\beta} + \frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\gamma} \right), \\
L_y &= -i\hbar \left(-\sin\alpha \cot\beta \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} + \cos\alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\beta} + \frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\gamma} \right), \\
L_z &= -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}.
\end{aligned}
```


## Wigner $ùîá$ and $d$ matrices

Wigner's Eqs. (11.18) and (11.19) define the real orthogonal
transformation ``\mathbf{R}`` by
```math
x'_i = R_{ij} x_j
```
and the operator ``\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{R}}`` to act on a function
``f`` such that
```math
\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{R}} f(x'_1, \ldots) = f(x_1, \ldots).
```
Then, his Eq. (15.5) presumably implies
```math
Y_{\ell,m}(\vartheta', \varphi')
= \mathbf{P}_{\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\}} Y_{\ell,m}(\vartheta, \varphi)
= \sum_{m'} \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}(\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\})_{m',m}
  Y_{\ell,m'}(\vartheta, \varphi),
```
where ``\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\}`` takes ``(\vartheta, \varphi)`` to
``(\vartheta', \varphi')``.  In any case, we can now leave behind this
``\mathbf{P}`` notation and just look at the beginning and end of the
equation above as the critical relationship in Wigner's notation.


Eq. (44b) of [Boyle (2016)](@cite Boyle_2016) says
```math
L_{\pm} \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(\mathbf{R})
= \sqrt{(\ell \mp m')(\ell \pm m' + 1)} \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m' \pm 1, m}(\mathbf{R}).
```
while Eq. (21) relates the Wigner D-matrix to the spin-weighted spherical harmonics as
```math
{}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}(\mathbf{R})
= (-1)^s \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}} \mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m,-s}(\mathbf{R}).
```
Plugging the latter into the former, we get
```math
L_{\pm} {}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}(\mathbf{R})
= \sqrt{(\ell \mp m)(\ell \pm m + 1)} {}_{s}Y_{\ell,m \pm 1}(\mathbf{R}).
```
That is, in our conventions we have
```math
\alpha^{\pm}_{\ell,m} = \sqrt{(\ell \mp m)(\ell \pm m + 1)},
```
which is always real and positive, and thus consistent with the Condon-Shortley phase
convention.


### Properties

* $D^j_{m'm}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) = (-1)^{m'-m} D^j_{-m',-m}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)^*$
