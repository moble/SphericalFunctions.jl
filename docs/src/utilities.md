# Utilities

While not usually the star of the show, the following utilities can be quite helpful for actually
using the rest of the code.


## Complex powers

One common task we find when working with spherical functions is the computation of a range of
integer powers of some complex number ‚Äî so much so that it can be best to pre-compute the powers and
cache their values.  While a naive approach is generally quite accurate, and reasonably fast, we can
do a little better with a specialized routine.

```@autodocs
Modules = [SphericalFunctions]
Pages   = ["complex_powers.jl"]
Order   = [:module, :type, :constant, :function, :macro]
```


## Sizes of and indexing into ``ùîá``, ``d``, and ``Y`` data

By ``Y`` data, we mean anything indexed like ``Y_{\ell, m}`` modes; by ``D``
data, we mean anything indexed like Wigner's ``\mathfrak{D}`` matrices, or
special subsets of them, like the ``H`` matrices.

```@autodocs
Modules = [SphericalFunctions]
Pages   = ["indexing.jl", "wigner_matrices/indexing.jl", "wigner_matrices/Hrecursions.jl"]
Order   = [:module, :type, :constant, :function, :macro]
```


## Combinatorics

Spherical functions frequently involve binomial coefficients and similar terms, with arguments
proportional to ``‚Ñì``, which we aim to allow to be very large ‚Äî of order 1,000 or more.
Unfortunately, due to combinatorical explosions, this is frequently infeasible with naive
methods.  Here, we collect any specialized methods that help us beat the limits.
