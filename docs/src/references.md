The most important routine in this package is the computation of the 𝔇 matrices
— or more specifically, of terms proportional to parts of the 𝔇 matrices.  This
mostly follows the treatment of [Gumerov_2015](@citet) (with minor modifications
to account for errors in their presentation, as described
[here](@ref "Steps to compute ``H`` (redesigned)")).  To seed
the recursions they present, we also need to calculate the associated Legendre
functions.  This is now done using the "fully normalized column-wise recurrence
formula" (fnCWF) given by Eqs. (12)—(14) of [Xing_2019](@citet).  This improves
significantly over the older implementation using the "modified forward row
method" of [Holmes_2002](@citet), for which the results would fail to be finite
starting at ℓ=22 for `Float16`, ℓ=183 for `Float32`, and ℓ=1474 for `Float64`.
Another approach that was never precisely implemented in this package was due to
[Fukushima_2011](@citet), who showed that using "X-numbers", wherein the
exponent is stored as a separate integer, (implemented in [this
package](https://github.com/moble/XNumbers.jl)) in the core of the recursion
could increase the range to ℓ≈2³².  Xing et al. showed that Fukushima's results
exhibited increased error for certain angles, whereas their Eqs. (12)—(14) could
be used directly to obtain results with greater accuracy for those certain
angles, and comparable accuracy for other angles.

The other major functionality of this package is `map2salm` / `salm2map`, which
decomposes function values on regular grids into mode weights (coefficients),
and vice versa.  The approach used here is taken from [Reinecke_2013](@citet),
with weights based on the method by [Waldvogel_2006](@citet).  However, this
interface has been superseded by the `SSHT` object, which implements several
approaches, including the Reinecke-Seljebotn-Waldvogel method, as well as the
optimal-dimensionality method due to [Elahi_2018](@citet), as well as a new
unpublished optimal-dimensionality method I (Mike Boyle) created.
