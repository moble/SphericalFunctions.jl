# Comparisons

Here, we compare our conventions to other sources, including
references in the literature as well as other software that implements
some of these.  Each of these comparisons is also performed explicitly
in [this package's test
suite](https://github.com/moble/SphericalFunctions.jl/tree/main/test/conventions).

Among the items that would be good to compare are the following, when
actually used by any of these sources:
* Quaternions
  - Order of components
  - Basis
  - Operation as rotations
* Euler angles
* Spherical coordinates
* Spherical harmonics
  - Condon-Shortley phase
  - Formula
* Spin-weighted spherical harmonics
  - Behavior under rotation
* Wigner D-matrices
  - Order of indices
  - Conjugation
  - Function of rotation or inverse rotation
  - Formula

One major result of this is that almost everyone since 1935 has used
the same exact expression for the (scalar) spherical harmonics.
