# Introduction

1. TODO: Figure out how to define conventions for the operators programmatically.

2. TODO: Finalize my conventions

3. TODO: Finish comparisons, using final conventions

4. TODO: Review front matter; make consistent with new conventions

8. TODO: Enable both `m′ₘₐₓ` and `mₘₐₓ` limits

5. TODO: Try to create a simpler interface `D(ℓₘₐₓ, R)` and `D!` that can operate just on that return value (with optional `m′ₘₐₓ, mₘₐₓ`)

6. TODO: Make return values a special object that can iterate and be indexed, returning `OffsetArray`s of views into the underlying `Vector`.

7. TODO: Break iterations into more-reusable pieces


This is a Julia package for evaluating and transforming Wigner's 𝔇
matrices, and spin-weighted spherical harmonics ``{}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}``
(which includes the ordinary scalar spherical harmonics).  Because
[*both* 𝔇 *and* the harmonics are most correctly considered](@cite
Boyle_2016) functions on the rotation group ``𝐒𝐎(3)`` — or more
generally, the spin group ``𝐒𝐩𝐢𝐧(3) \cong 𝐒𝐔(2)`` that covers it
— these functions are evaluated directly in terms of quaternions.
Concessions are also made for more standard forms of spherical
coordinates and Euler angles.[^1] Among other applications, those
functions permit "synthesis" (evaluation of the spin-weighted
spherical functions) of spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients
on regular or distorted grids.  This package also includes functions
enabling efficient "analysis" (decomposition into mode coefficients)
of functions evaluated on regular grids to high order and accuracy.

These quantities are computed using recursion relations, which makes
it possible to compute to very high ℓ values.  Unlike direct
evaluation of individual elements, which would generally cause
overflow or underflow beyond ℓ≈30 when using double precision
(`Float64`), these recursion relations should be valid for far higher
ℓ values.  More precisely, when using *this* package, `Inf` values
appear starting at ℓ=128 for `Float16`, but I have not yet found any
for values up to at least ℓ=1024 with `Float32`, and presumably far
higher for `Float64`.  `BigFloat` also works, and presumably will not
overflow for any ℓ value that could reasonably fit into computer
memory — though it is far slower.  Also note that
[`DoubleFloats`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl) will
work, and achieve significantly greater accuracy (but no greater ℓ
range) than `Float64`.  In all cases, results are typically accurate
to roughly ℓ times the precision of the underlying float type.

The conventions for this package diverge from its predecessors found
[here](https://moble.github.io/spherical_functions/) and
[here](https://moble.github.io/spherical/), but are described in
detail on [this page](@ref Summary) and the following pages, including
detailed comparisons to other sources that are tested automatically
with each change to this code.

Note that numerous other packages cover some of these use cases,
including
[`FastTransforms.jl`](https://JuliaApproximation.github.io/FastTransforms.jl/),
[`FastSphericalHarmonics.jl`](https://eschnett.github.io/FastSphericalHarmonics.jl/dev/),
[`WignerSymbols.jl`](https://github.com/Jutho/WignerSymbols.jl), and
[`WignerFamilies.jl`](https://github.com/xzackli/WignerFamilies.jl).
However, I need support for quaternions (via
[`Quaternionic.jl`](https://github.com/moble/Quaternionic.jl)) and for
higher-precision numbers — even at the cost of a very slight decrease
in speed in some cases — which are what this package provides.


[^1]:
    Euler angles are quite generally a very poor choice for computing with
    rotations.  (The only context in which they may be preferred is when
    *analytically* integrating some analytically known functions.)  Almost
    universally, it is best to use quaternions when computing with rotations.
    All the computations done within this package use quaternions; the user
    interfaces involving Euler angles essentially convert to/from quaternions.
    While the calculations needed for those conversions would still need to be
    done if this package used Euler angles internally — meaning that this
    approach is as efficient as any — that work can be avoided entirely if you
    work with quaternions directly.
