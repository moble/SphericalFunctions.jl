# Introduction

This is a Julia package for evaluating and transforming Wigner's ùîá matrices,
and spin-weighted spherical harmonics ``{}_{s}Y_{\ell,m}`` (which includes the
ordinary scalar spherical harmonics).  These functions are evaluated directly in
terms of quaternions, as well as in the more standard forms of spherical
coordinates and Euler angles.[^1]  Among other applications, those functions
permit "synthesis" (evaluation of the spin-weighted spherical functions) of
spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients on regular or distorted grids.
This package also includes functions enabling efficient "analysis"
(decomposition into mode coefficients) of functions evaluated on regular grids
to high order and accuracy.

These quantities are computed using recursion relations, which makes it possible
to compute to very high ‚Ñì values.  Unlike direct evaluation of individual
elements, which will generally cause overflow or underflow beyond ‚Ñì‚âà30 when
using double precision, these recursion relations should be valid for far higher
‚Ñì values.  More precisely, when using *this* package, `Inf` values appear
starting at ‚Ñì=22 for `Float16`, ‚Ñì=183 for `Float32`, and ‚Ñì=1474 for `Float64`.
`BigFloat` also works, and presumably will not overflow for any ‚Ñì value that
could reasonably fit into computer memory ‚Äî though it is far slower.  Also note
that [`DoubleFloats`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl) will work,
and achieve significantly greater accuracy (but no greater range) than
`Float64`.  Using Julia's built-in `BigFloat` type will achieve far higher
accuracy *and* range, but incurs memory-allocation costs.  Typically, results
are accurate to roughly ‚Ñì times the precision of the input quaternion.

The conventions for this package are described in detail on [this
page](https://moble.github.io/spherical_functions/).

Note that numerous other packages cover some of these use cases, including
[`FastTransforms.jl`](https://JuliaApproximation.github.io/FastTransforms.jl/),
[`FastSphericalHarmonics.jl`](https://eschnett.github.io/FastSphericalHarmonics.jl/dev/),
[`WignerSymbols.jl`](https://github.com/Jutho/WignerSymbols.jl), and
[`WignerFamilies.jl`](https://github.com/xzackli/WignerFamilies.jl).  However, I
need support for quaternions (via
[`Quaternionic.jl`](https://github.com/moble/Quaternionic.jl)) and for
higher-precision numbers ‚Äî even at the cost of a very slight decrease in speed
in some cases ‚Äî which are what this package provides.

[^1]:
    Euler angles are quite generally a very poor choice for computing with
    rotations.  (The only context in which they may be preferred is when
    *analytically* integrating some analytically known functions.)  Almost
    universally, it is best to use quaternions when computing with rotations.
    All the computations done within this package use quaternions; the user
    interfaces involving Euler angles essentially convert to/from quaternions.
    While the calculations needed for those conversions would still need to be
    done if this package used Euler angles internally ‚Äî meaning that this
    approach is as efficient as any ‚Äî that work can be avoided entirely if you
    work with quaternions directly.
