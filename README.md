This is a Julia package for evaluating and transforming Wigner's ùîá matrices, the associated Legendre
functions, and spin-weighted spherical harmonics (which includes the ordinary scalar spherical
harmonics).  See [the documentation](https://moble.github.io/SphericalFunctions.jl/) for more
details.


## Installation

```bash
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SphericalFunctions")
```

###### <sup>1</sup> Euler angles are inadequate

Euler angles are quite generally a very poor choice for computing with rotations.  (The only context
in which they may be preferred is when *analytically* integrating some analytically known
functions.)  Almost universally, it is best to use quaternions when computing with rotations.  All
the computations done within this package use quaternions; the user interfaces involving Euler
angles essentially convert to/from quaternions.  While the calculations needed for those conversions
would still need to be done if this package used Euler angles internally ‚Äî meaning that this
approach is as efficient as any ‚Äî that work can be avoided entirely if you work with quaternions
directly.
